   *Red light \+ green light = not fully charged*

1. Plug the power cord of the battery charger into a power outlet\. When only the green light is illuminated, your battery is fully charged\.

1. Disconnect the charged vehicle battery's white 3\-pin connector from the charge adapter\. If you removed the battery to charge it \(optional\) make sure to reconnect its red 2\-pin connector to the vehicle drive train connector and secure the battery to the vehicle with the Velcro strap\. 

1. Turn on the vehicle drive train by pushing its switch to the "on" position\. Listen for the indicator sound \(two short beeps\) to confirm a successful charge\. If you don't hear two beeps, try [unlocking your vehicle battery](deepracer-troubleshooting-unlock-dead-vehicle-batteries.md)

Your AWS DeepRacer drive module battery is now ready for use\.
