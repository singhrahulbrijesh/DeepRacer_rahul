# Manage an AWS DeepRacer Community Race<a name="deepracer-manage-community-races"></a>

All community races are private\. They are visible only to individuals who have received an invitation link\. Participants can freely forward invitation links\. However, to join a race, participants need an AWS account\. First\-time users must complete the account creation process before they can join the race\. 

As the race organizer, you can edit race details, including the start and end dates, and remove participants\.

   Removing a participant from an event revokes the user's permissions to access the racing event\.
